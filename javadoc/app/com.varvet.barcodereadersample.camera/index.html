<p>Manages the camera in conjunction with an underlying com.google.android.gms.vision.Detector. This receives preview frames from the camera at a specified rate, sending those frames to the detector as fast as it is able to process those frames.  This camera source makes a best effort to manage processing on preview frames as fast as possible, while at the same time minimizing lag. As such, frames may be dropped if the detector is unable to keep up with the rate of frames generated by the camera. You should use <code><a href="-camera-source/-builder/set-requested-fps.html">CameraSource.Builder#setRequestedFps(float)</a></code> to specify a frame rate that works well with the capabilities of the camera hardware and the detector options that you have selected. If CPU utilization is higher than you'd like, then you may want to consider reducing FPS. If the camera preview or detector results are too "jerky", then you may want to consider increasing FPS.  The following Android permission is required to use the camera: <ul> <li>android.permissions.CAMERA</li>
 </ul>
